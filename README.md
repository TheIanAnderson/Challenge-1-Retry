# HoriSEOn SEO site

## This is a test-site for my first Challenge with the UTA coding bootcamp

This project was for me to skim through and correct semantic errors in the html and css, as well as add proper id's, classes, 
and alt text for images, as well as fulfill all of the acceptance criteria.
